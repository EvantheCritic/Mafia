                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">How to play</h2>
                <p>
                    There are 16 players you can choose from. 5 players are mafia and 11 players are citizens.
                    The goal for the mafia is to eliminate all the citizens and for the citizens to eliminate all the mafia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the citizens. One player is a sheriff who's goal is to accuse other players as mafia before eliminating
                    them. And two players are doctors which must try to save the player the mafia is targeting. The rest of the players
                    are civilians whom will not know which characters are Mafia, sheriff, or doctors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each round will start with the Mafia selecting one player to eliminate. Then the cop will select a player
                    to accuse as mafia. Then the doctors will select a player to save. The results will be shown afterwars and the
                    selected players will be eliminated unless saved by a doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The round will end with all the players voting for who they would like to eliminate. If the eliminated player's 
                    card turns red, they were a mafia. If it turns blue, they were a citizen. The game ends when there are more mafia
                    than citizens, or all mafia have been eliminated
                </p>
                <p>Please note: if you refresh the page, the game will restart! And different roles will be assigned to the players.</p>
                <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
